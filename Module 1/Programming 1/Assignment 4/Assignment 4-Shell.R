#Programming 1 - Assignment 4
#Your name(s): Andrew Harper, Andrew Singh


# The file Toyota4.csv includes data for 1000 used Toyota Corollas, 
# including their prices and specification information:

#Price (in dollars)
#Age (in months)
#Mileage 
#Horse_Power
#Metallic_Color (1=yes, 0=no)
#Automatic (1=yes, 0=no)
#CC (cylinder volume)
#Doors
#Weight (in kg)
#Fuel Type (diesel, petrol, CNG)


# Load "Toyota4.csv" and save it as carsData.
# Load any packages that you may use for this assignment
carsData = read.csv("Toyota4.csv")

#Q1:
# Identify the variable(s) with missing values.
# Locate and replace those values with the mean of non-missing values.
# Identify the variable(s) with missing values
missing_vars <- colnames(carsData)[colSums(is.na(carsData)) > 0]
print(paste("Variables with missing values:", paste(missing_vars, collapse = ", "))) 

# Replace missing values with the mean of non-missing values
for (var in missing_vars) {
  carsData[[var]][is.na(carsData[[var]])] <- mean(carsData[[var]], na.rm = TRUE)
}

# Verify that there are no more missing values
sum(is.na(carsData))


#Q2:
# Summarize the fuel type variable using a frequency table and a plot.
# Return the name of the most common fuel type category.
# Summarize the fuel type variable using a frequency table
fuel_type_summary <- table(carsData$Fuel_Type)
print(fuel_type_summary)

# Plot the fuel type variable
ggplot(carsData, aes(x = Fuel_Type)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Fuel Types", x = "Fuel Type", y = "Count")

# Identify the most common fuel type category
most_common_fuel_type <- names(fuel_type_summary)[which.max(fuel_type_summary)]
print(paste("The most common fuel type category is:", most_common_fuel_type))



#Q3:
# Create a boxplot that compares the distribution of price across different fuel types.
# Also, write a code that calculates the average price for each of these fuel type categories.
# Which fuel category has the highest average price? 
# (write a code that returns both the name and the average price of this category)

# Create a boxplot comparing the distribution of price across different fuel types

# Calculate the average price for each fuel type category
average_price_by_fuel <- carsData %>%
  group_by(Fuel_Type) %>%
  summarize(Average_Price = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE))

print(average_price_by_fuel)

# Identify the fuel category with the highest average price
highest_avg_price <- average_price_by_fuel %>%
  filter(Average_Price == max(Average_Price))

print(paste("The fuel category with the highest average price is:", highest_avg_price$Fuel_Type, "with an average price of", highest_avg_price$Average_Price))


#Q4:
# Create two scatterplots: Price (y-axis) vs. Age (x-axis), Price (y-axis) vs. Mileage (x-axis)
# In an attempt to know which variable (Age or Mileage) is more strongly correlated with price,
# report the correlation coefficient for both.

# Create scatterplot for Price vs. Age
ggplot(carsData, aes(x = Age, y = Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Price vs. Age", x = "Age", y = "Price")

# Create scatterplot for Price vs. Mileage
ggplot(carsData, aes(x = Mileage, y = Price)) +

# Calculate the correlation coefficient for Price vs. Age
cor_price_age <- cor(carsData$Price, carsData$Age, use = "complete.obs")

# Calculate the correlation coefficient for Price vs. Mileage
cor_price_mileage <- cor(carsData$Price, carsData$Mileage, use = "complete.obs")
print(paste("Correlation coefficient between Price and Mileage:", cor_price_mileage))




#Q5:
# Detect and remove outliers in terms of Price using the z-score method (z > 3 or z < -3).
# Write a code to return the number of outliers and save the cleaned data as carsUpdated.
# Note: While there are various methods for detecting outliers, use the z-score approach for this exercise.

# Calculate the z-scores for the Price variable
carsData$z_score <- (carsData$Price - mean(carsData$Price, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(carsData$Price, na.rm = TRUE)

# Identify outliers
outliers <- carsData %>% filter(abs(z_score) > 3)

# Count the number of outliers
num_outliers <- nrow(outliers)
print(paste("Number of outliers:", num_outliers))

# Remove outliers
carsUpdated <- carsData %>% filter(abs(z_score) <= 3)

# Drop the z_score column as it's no longer needed
carsUpdated <- carsUpdated %>% select(-z_score)



#Q6: 
# Run a simple linear regression of price using age as the predictor. (use the updated dataset)
# Save the results as regAge. Write a code that returns the summary of the results.

# Run the simple linear regression
regAge <- lm(Price ~ Age, data = carsUpdated)

# Return the summary of the results
summary(regAge)


#Q7: 
# Run a simple linear regression of price using mileage as the predictor. (use the updated dataset)
# Save the results as regMileage. Write a code that returns the summary of the results.

# Run the simple linear regression
regMileage <- lm(Price ~ Mileage, data = carsUpdated)

# Return the summary of the results
summary(regMileage)


#Q8: 
# Run a multiple linear regression of price using both age and mileage as predictors. (use the updated dataset)
# Save the results as regBoth. Write a code that returns the summary of the results.

# Run the multiple linear regression
regBoth <- lm(Price ~ Age + Mileage, data = carsUpdated)

# Return the summary of the results
summary(regBoth)



#Q9:
# Create a table that compares the three regression models in terms of residual standard error and adjusted r-squares. 
# (Note: you can do so by building a dataframe of the desired outputs or using stargazer function. 
# In either case, make sure reach row/column is labeled accordingly.)


# Generate the comparison table
stargazer(regAge, regMileage, regBoth, 
          type = "text", 
          title = "Comparison of Regression Models",
          dep.var.labels = "Price",
          covariate.labels = c("Age", "Mileage", "Intercept"),
          keep.stat = c("n", "rsq", "adj.rsq", "ser"),
          column.labels = c("Simple Linear Regresssion Age", "Simple Linear Regression Mileage", "Multiple Linear Regression"))
