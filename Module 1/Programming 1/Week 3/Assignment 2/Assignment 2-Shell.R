# Preparation: Load the required packages.
library(tidyverse)

#Part 1:

#Q1:
# Load the World values survey data "WorldValues3.csv" and save it as WorldData. 
# Load the country code data "CountryCodes3.csv" and save it as CountryData.
WorldData = read.csv("WorldValues3.csv")
CountryData = read.csv("CountryCodes3.csv")


#Q2:
# Join the country name from the CountryCode data into WorldData. 
# Note that country code is called *ID* in CountryData and *CountryCode* in WorldData. 
# Return the first 10 unique countries. 

# Perform a join to add countrycode to WorldData
WorldData <- left_join(WorldData, CountryData, by = c("CountryCode" = "ID"))

# Return the first 10 unique countries
unique_countries <-head( unique(WorldData$Country),10)
print(unique_countries)


#Q3:
# Update WorldData by dropping income, education, and lifeexpect variables.
# What is the dimension of the updated WorldData?

# Drop Income, Education, and life expect
WorldData <- WorldData %>% select(-Income, -Education, - lifeexpect)

# Get the dimension of the updated WorldData
dim(WorldData)

#Q4:
# Using pipes, calculate the average age and percent immigrant (i.e., average ratio of immigrants) for every country.
# Display the top 5 countries in terms of average age. 
# Hint: For displaying the top 5, refer to the help for slice( ) to find the right form of the function to use.
# Calculate average age and percent immigrant for every country
CountryStats <- WorldData %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%  summarize(avg_age = mean((2024-BirthYear)),percent_immigrant = mean(Immigrant)*100)


# Display the top 5 countries in terms of average age
top_5_countries <- CountryStats %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_age)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)

# Print the top 5 countries
print(top_5_countries) 

#need to put in percent

#Q5:
# Group WorldData by country and marital status and show the percent of people in each category who are immigrants.
# Show the results for China. (the coding for the *Marital* variable is 1 = Married, 2 = Living together, 3 = Divorced, 
# 4 = Separated, 5 = Widowed, and 6 = Single).


ImmigrantStats <- WorldData %>%
  group_by(Country, Marital) %>%
  summarise(
    percent_immigrant = mean(Immigrant, na.rm = TRUE) * 100
  ) 

# Filter the results for China
ChinaImmigrantStats <- ImmigrantStats %>%
  filter(Country == "China")

# Print the results for China
print(ChinaImmigrantStats)
#Q6: 
# Using pipes, create a function that takes a country name and calculates its average life satisfaction ("Satisfied") 
# broken down by "immigrant". Name this function meanSat. Show the results for China.


# Define the function meanSat
meanSat <- function(country_name) {
  WorldData %>%
    filter(Country == country_name) %>%
    group_by(Immigrant) %>%
    summarise(
      avg_satisfaction = mean(Satisfied, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

# Show the results for China
ChinaSatisfaction <- meanSat("China")

# Print the results for China
print(ChinaSatisfaction)

#Part 2: 
# Load the web analytics data "WebAnalytics3.csv" and save it as analytics.

analytics = read.csv("WebAnalytics3.csv")

#Q7:
# Use base R to draw the scatterplot of TimeOnPage (x axis) versus PageViews (y axis).
# Make sure to change the shape, color, and size of the points. 
# Also, set your own labels for both axes and add a title to the plot. 
# In addition, set a limit on the x axis to be between 0 and 300,000.


plot(analytics$TimeOnPage, analytics$PageViews,
     pch = 19, # Change the shape of the points
     col = "darkgreen", # Change the color of the points
     cex = 1.5, # Change the size of the points
     xlab = "Time on Page (seconds)", # Set the x-axis label
     ylab = "Page Views", # Set the y-axis label
     main = "Scatterplot of Time on Page vs. Page Views", # Add a title to the plot
     xlim = c(0, 300000) # Set the limit on the x-axis
)
#Q8:
# Recreate the same plot using ggplot. 
# (You can refer to ggplot cheatsheet or its reference page online for an overview of all the arguments.)
# (For example, here are some examples of geom_point() options: 
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html

ggplot(analytics, aes(x = TimeOnPage, y = PageViews)) +
  geom_point(shape = 19, color = "darkgreen", size = 2) + # Change the shape, color, and size of the points
  labs(
    x = "Time on Page (seconds)", # Set the x-axis label
    y = "Page Views", # Set the y-axis label
    title = "Scatterplot of Time on Page vs. Page Views" # Add a title to the plot
  ) +
  xlim(0, 300000) # Set a limit on the x-axis


#Q9:
# a. Use ggplot to draw the scatterplot of TotalDownloads (x axis) versus ConversionRate (y axis).
# b. Draw a similar plot but add jitters. Use a theme and a color.
# (For both parts, read TotalDownloads as a factor for visual clarity on the x axis.)

# Convert TotalDownloads to a factor for visual clarity on the x axis
analytics$TotalDownloads <- as.factor(analytics$TotalDownloads)

# Create the scatterplot
ggplot(analytics, aes(x = TotalDownloads, y = ConversionRate)) +
  geom_point(shape = 19, color = "blue", size = 2) + # Customize the points
  labs(
    x = "Total Downloads", # Set the x-axis label
    y = "Conversion Rate", # Set the y-axis label
    title = "Scatterplot of Total Downloads vs. Conversion Rate" # Add a title to the plot
  ) +
  theme_minimal() # Use a minimal theme

# Create the scatterplot with jitters
ggplot(analytics, aes(x = TotalDownloads, y = ConversionRate)) +
  geom_jitter(shape = 19, color = "darkgreen", size = 2, width = 0.2, height = 0) + # Add jitters and customize the points
  labs(
    x = "Total Downloads", # Set the x-axis label
    y = "Conversion Rate", # Set the y-axis label
    title = "Scatterplot of Total Downloads vs. Conversion Rate with Jitters" # Add a title to the plot
  ) +
  theme_classic() # Use a classic theme


#Q10:
# Create a boxplot with Region as categories (x-axis) and ConversionRate as the outcome of interest (y-axis).
# Change the (border/points) color of the boxplots.
# In addition, add a title, a subtitle, and a blank x axis label. 
# In so doing, adjust the location, size, and the color of the title and the subtitle.

ggplot(analytics, aes(x = Region, y = ConversionRate)) +
  geom_boxplot(color = "darkblue", fill = "lightblue") + # Change the border and fill color of the boxplots
  labs(
    title = "Conversion Rate by Region",
    subtitle = "Analysis of Conversion Rates across Different Regions",
    x = "", # Blank x-axis label
    y = "Conversion Rate"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, color = "darkgreen"), # Adjust title location, size, and color
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = "darkred") # Adjust subtitle location, size, and color
  )


#Q11:
# Create the same box plot of Q10 but use facet wrap to separate by Source.
# Also, fill each boxplot with different colors based on Source and 
# add a color legend to the bottom of the plot.

ggplot(analytics, aes(x = Region, y = ConversionRate, fill = Source)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ Source) +
  labs(
    title = "Conversion Rate by Region and Source",
    subtitle = "Analysis of Conversion Rates across Different Regions and Sources",
    x = "", 
    y = "Conversion Rate"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, color = "darkred"), # Adjust title location, size, and color
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 12, color = "darkgreen"), # Adjust subtitle location, size, and color
    legend.position = "bottom" # Position the legend at the bottom
  )
